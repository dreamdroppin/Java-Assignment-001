# Assignment 1: Error Exploration in Hello World Program

## Objective
Commit various errors in the Hello World program to observe and understand the compiler's error messages. Follow the steps below:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository locally to your machine.
3. Create a new branch named Feature001.

## Instructions
Make each of the modifications listed below, and perform the steps noted after #10 for each error:

1. Remove one of the opening curly braces.
2. Remove one of the closing curly braces.
3. Instead of main, write mian.
4. Remove the word static.
5. Remove the word public.
6. Remove the word System.
7. Replace println with Println.
8. Replace println with print.
9. Delete one parenthesis.
10. Add an extra parenthesis.

After making each change:
1. Compile/Run the program using the IntelliJ IDE
2. Read the error message (if any)
4. Ensure that you take a screenshot of each error message.
3. Then correct the error.

## Naming the Screenshots
Save each error message screenshot like error01.png, error02.png, ..., errorN.png, etc. in your project directory.

**Note:** This exercise aims to familiarize you with various error scenarios and help you interpret compiler messages. It enhances your ability to troubleshoot and understand common programming mistakes.

## Submission
Just as you did in the first lab (Reference the Lab video in your Week 1 module):
1. create a Feature01 branch of your code if you haven't already.
2. Commit your working code and images to your local copy/Feature001 branch
3. Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e. GitHub: Feature01 -> origin/Feature01)
4. Then issue a Pull request to my instructor repo
5. **Make sure to COPY the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab/assignment in Canvas.**
